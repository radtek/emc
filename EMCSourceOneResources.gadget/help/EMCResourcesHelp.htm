<div class="par"><div class="pictext">Below is the introduction of the tool, it's from the introduction of EMC IT Resource Gadget, and the copyrights belong to EMC and IT team. Here I didn't modify below content to show the respect to the original author.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext">The EMC Windows 7 Resource Gadget is a tool for the Windows 7 desktop that provides users with easy access to
various EMC resources.  Resources may be phone numbers, email addresses, or web sites.  Each set of resources
is grouped under a heading and users can choose which sets to display on the desktop.  The full list of available
resources can be displayed on demand at any time.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="smallform.gif" title="Small Form" alt="Small Form"/></div>
The gadget can appear in either a small or a large form on the desktop.  When started it initially displays the small
form which has room to display a single resource set.  Any email or website shown can be clicked and a new window
will be opened giving access to that resource.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="smallall.gif" title="More Resources" alt="More Resources"/></div>
Clicking the <img src='helpsmall.png' title='Help' alt='Help' /> icon at the bottom of the form displays this help page. <br />
Clicking the <img src='fbsmall.png' title='Feedback' alt='Feedback' /> icon opens the feedback discussion page on EMC|One. <br />
Clicking the <img src='allsmall.png' title='More' alt='More' /> icon opens a side window
which lists all of the known resource sets.  This list can be scrolled to find the desired entry.  Email and website entries on the
list are clickable. <br /><br />
At the bottom of the full list of resources is the date that the list was last updated.  The gadget will automatically check once
each day to see if an updated list is available on the <a href="http://itcentral.corp.emc.com/gcc/EMCResources" target="gcc">GCC website</a>.
If it can not connect it will retry every 10 minutes.  The window shows the date and time that a connection was last made and 
provides an "Update Now!" button to force an immediate update.  Click anywhere on the desktop or another application to 
close the side window and return to the small display form. </div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="smallinfo.gif" title="System Information" alt="System Information"/></div>
Clicking the <img src='infosmall.png' title='Info' alt='Info' /> icon at the bottom of the form opens a page with general system information.  This is intended
primarily for use when working with a remote tech support agent.  It provides the local host name, serial number, and network
addresses that the agent may need.  <!-- This screen also connects to the IT Support Desk and retrieves the current operational
status information banner which then scrolls across the bottom of the window.  Click anywhere on the desktop or another application to 
close the side window and return to the small display form. --></div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="smalloptions.gif" title="Options" alt="options"/></div>
Moving the mouse over the small form and pausing briefly will cause an additional options panel to appear.
The 'X' at the top of the options list closes the gadget.  To re-open the gadget right-click on the desktop and select 'Gadgets'
and then drag the 'EMC Resources' icon from the gadgets list onto the desktop.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="largeform.gif" title="Large Form" alt="Large Form"/></div>
The second option icon is a square with an arrow pointing to the upper right.  This icon opens the larger version of the EMC
Resources gadget window.<br /><br />
The large form will show 1 or 2 columns of resource information depending on user selections.  The <img src='allsmall.png' title='More' alt='More' />, <img src='infosmall.png' title='Info' alt='Info' />, 
<img src='helpsmall.png' title='Help' alt='Help' />, and <img src='fbsmall.png' title='Feedback' alt='Feedback' /> icons
at the bottom function just like they do on the small form.  Hovering the mouse over the large form shows the same additional options panel except that
the second icon is now a square with an arrow pointing down.  Clicking that will restore the small form on the display.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="smallsettings.gif" title="Small Settings" alt="Small Settings"/></div>
The third option icon is a wrench or spanner and is used to open the user settings window.  If the small form is currently displayed
when this option is chosen the user will be able to select a single resource set for display on the form.<br /><br />
This screen shows the same 'Last Updated' information as the full resource list does.  It also allows the user to check for any
updates to the resource lists on demand by clicking the "Update Now!" button.<br /><br />
Click the OK button to update the resource set to be displayed on the small form.  Click the Cancel button to return to the small form
without changing the display selection.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="largesettings.gif" title="Large Settings" alt="Large Settings"/></div>
When the setting option is used and the large form is currently displayed
the user will be able to select multiple resource sets to display on the large form.  The gadget will display as many as will fit in the first column
of the form and then fill the second column.  If too many resource sets are chosen any that will not fit on the form will be ignored.
The order in which the sets are listed can be modified using the middle section of the settings form.  Click on the name of any set in the list
and then click the up and down arrows to re-arrange the list.  
<br /><br />
The  'Last Updated' information works like it does on the full resource list and small for settings windows.<br /><br />
Click the OK button to update the resource sets to be displayed on the large form.  Click the Cancel button to return to the large form
without changing the display selections.</div></div>

<div class="par"><div class="pictext"><div class="pic"><img src="options.gif" title="Options Panel" alt="Options Panel"/></div>
The last item on the options panel is a rectangular grid of dots and is used to move the gadget around
the desktop.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the grid and drag the gadget to the desired location.</div></div>
